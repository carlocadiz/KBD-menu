        <p>Hello <br/><br />

          I am a Junior Web Developer who has had a lifelong passion for coding. After 12 years as an Office Supervisor,
          I changed my career focus to pursue this passion and joined the Web Development Bootcamp at Lighthouse Labs. The tech stack used in our camp focused on Javascript, Nodejs,
          React, Ruby on Rails and other frameworks and libraries. I learned quite a bit at the bootcamp but I know there is so much more to learn.<br /><br />

          I am now seeking a full stack position to continue my development and growth in coding. Although, I may have started my career in the software development field
          later in my life, I believe my maturity and goal to succeed sets me apart.<br /><br />

          Regards,<br />
          Carlo Cadiz</p>
